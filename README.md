# BOUNDARIES

.ᐟ⌯⌲ Do not touch my character if I have DNTUF or DNT [Unless youre a close friend]

.ᐟ⌯⌲ Do not try and force me to do things I don't want to do, I block these kinds of people or grow distant from them easily

.ᐟ⌯⌲ If I move away from you in game that means I don't want to be touched

.ᐟ⌯⌲ If I move away from you AND hide behind an object or another character, I do not want to be touched by you or interact with you. Half of the people that do these are trolls or just people I'm uncomfy around so I'll either hide or block you

.ᐟ⌯⌲ I am a MINOR. I am not 8 or 10 but I am a MINOR and I do not want any sexual comments targeted towards me
